	<b>Q1 If I join the avengers can I fight some of the battles as I like without violating the Sokovia Accords?</b><br>
    Ans:Unfortunately, after the Nigeria incident Avengers is no longer a private organisation and it
		has to follow all the rules and regulations set by the United Nations. While the avengers still fight for
		what they believe in they now have to do so while following the instructions given in the accords.<br><br>
	<b>Q2 Will I be able to keep my identity a secret?</b><br>
	Ans:The answer to this question is unfortunately no. Under the Sokovia Accords anyone who joins
		the Avengers has to register themselves under the United Nations. They have to provide their
		biometrics and complete information regarding their powers and it does not matter whether the
		individual are human, inhuman or extra-terrestrial beings. The UN gets to determine their threat
		level and any individual with inate power has to wear a tracking device at all times.<br><br>
	<b>Q3 What are the criteria to be met to apply for this job?</b><br>
	Ans:i) You need to be skilled in one or many combat arts.
		ii) You need to have some past experiences with being a superhero.
